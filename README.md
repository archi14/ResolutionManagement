My take for the solution of the PhonePe problem https://github.com/Rudraprakash054/phonepe-machine-code. Thanks for providing the problem to the user.

I tried to keep the code modular with seperate model, repo, service layers.
I've utilized strategy, builder pattern. Additional we can also employ factory pattern and singleton pattern.
